# TextRecognition
This project is to achieve text recognition of 80% and above accuracy on the handwritten characters in the image and output the detected characters using different OCR tools. In order to recognize the handwritten characters more efficiently, image preprocessing must be done before the text detection process. The quality of the image is crucial as it will affect the accuracy of the text detection by OCR tools as the lower the quality of the image, the lower the chance of a character can be detected. Hence, a variety of image preprocessing techniques is performed to improve the quality of the image. For example, Pytesseract, EasyOCR, and KerasOCR are used.
